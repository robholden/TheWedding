    <p class="has-text-centered">
        <em>
            As we prepare to get married, we’re incredibly grateful to be surrounded by people who’ve shaped our lives in so many ways. Whether you&#39;re joining us in person or in spirit, we wanted to share a bit about the wedding ceremony — not just so
            you know what to expect, but because it means something deeply personal to us.
        </em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Our wedding will take place in the tradition of the Malankara Orthodox Church, which Reshma grew up in — a branch of Christianity that traces its roots all the way back to St. Thomas the Apostle, who is said to have arrived in Kerala, India, in 52
        A.D. Rooted in the Syriac Orthodox rite, this ceremony carries layers of meaning, prayer, and symbolism — inviting not just two people, but two families, communities, and heritages into a lifelong embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church is part of the Oriental Orthodox communion, which includes the ancient churches of Egypt, Armenia, Syria, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. The prayers and hymns used in the service are derived from the rich West Syriac
        liturgical tradition — many still sung in Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic, the language spoken by Christ. Today, services incorporate a blend of Syriac, Malayalam (the local language of Kerala), and occasionally English.
    </p>

    <h3 class="is-size-4">What Happens During the Ceremony?</h3>
    <p>There are two main parts of the service, both rich in symbolism and stillness.</p>

    <h4 class="is-size-5">1. Blessing of the Rings (Betrothal)</h4>

    <p>

        The ceremony begins with the blessing of the rings, during which the priest places the rings on the fourth finger of our right hands. Unlike many Western weddings, we won’t be exchanging the rings ourselves — they are placed by the priest, who
        serves as a representative of God signifying the importance of God in the marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
        The betrothal represents more than just commitment — it is a sacred contract, sealed before God and witnessed by family and friends. The rings symbolize a permanent bond and signify the lifelong nature of marriage, as their circular shape has no
        beginning or end.
    </p>

    <h4 class="is-size-5">2. Blessing of the Crowns (Crowning)</h4>
    <p>
        <img src="assets/images/crownblessing.png" width="150" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="15" VSPACE="5" />
        In a deeply symbolic moment, gold chains bearing crosses — often referred to as &quot;crowns&quot; — are placed over the heads of the bride and groom. This is one of the most beautiful parts of the ceremony, as it marks the beginning of a new
        shared life, filled with love, joy, sacrifice, and mutual care.
    </p>
    <p>The crowning also represents the glory and honour bestowed upon the couple as they enter this new life. It echoes the biblical imagery of Christ as the bridegroom and the Church as His bride, symbolizing a love that is both sacred and enduring.</p>

    <h4 class="is-size-5">Small Traditions, Deep Meaning</h4>
    <p>Beyond the formal parts of the service, there are two unique rituals woven into the ceremony that come from the Orthodox community’s blend of Christian faith and Indian (Hindu) culture.</p>

    <h4 class="is-size-5">1. Minnu (Wedding Pendant)</h4>
    <p>
        <img src="assets/images/pendant.jpg" width="225" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="15" VSPACE="10" />
        The Minnu is a gold cross pendant tied around the bride’s neck by the groom, using threads taken from her blessed wedding saree. The pendant includes seven small beads, representing the seven sacraments of the Church.
    </p>
    <p>The act of tying it with a knot symbolizes that we are bound together for life — spiritually and emotionally. It is one of the most personal and powerful moments in the service.</p>

    <h4 class="is-size-5">2. Manthrakodi (Blessed Wedding Saree)</h4>
    <p>Later in the ceremony, the groom places a specially blessed saree — known as the Manthrakodi — over the bride’s head. This tradition represents being welcomed into each other’s lives and families, as well as the start of a new life together.</p>
    <p>Biblically, it references the story of Rebecca, who veiled herself when she first met Isaac. Traditionally, this saree is carefully preserved for life, and is sometimes even worn again during final rites, as a symbol of lasting love.</p>
